Comments of my Friends:
1)Nice game, but not enough words to guess. You can spend free time and play it.
2)Normal game to test your vocabulary. But few words, I would like a little more. Still a good idea
3)Respect for the game, interesting and educational
4)Gallows game is cool. But there are a few things to fix. 1) there is no restart button when you lose2) add some words3) make the keyboard bigger
5)Good game, you can get stuck for a couple of minutes
6)The game is just a bomb, I would have played it if I did not know all the words.
7)Childhood game. I played and remembered how I sat and played through Mom's phone
